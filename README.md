## Getting Started

I suppose you have python3.5+, pip3 and git installed on a linux system. It's better to use a virtual environment to avoid further conflicts with system wide packages.

**Step 1**: Get a copy of project:

```$ git clone https://github.com/M-Ghasemi/Neural_Networks-KHU-97.git```

**Step 2**: Install required packages. make sure that you are in the root directory of the project.

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links```

**Step 3**: run jupyter notebook and open notebook files (or run python files or copy codes to ipython shell)
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
