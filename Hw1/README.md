# ANN-97-1-Hw1

Problems are in file ANN-97-1-Hw1.pdf

**All codes are executed and tested in file Hw1.ipynb**, you also can see the Hw1.htm or execute Hw1.py.
**Solutions that required written answers, are in ANN-97-1-Hw1_Solutions.pdf**

Question 1 is implemented in perceptron.py file, and question 2 is implemented in adaline.py file.

## Getting Started

I suppose you have python3.5+, pip3 and git installed on a linux system. It's better to use a virtual environment to avoid further conflicts with system wide packages.

**Step 1**: Get a copy of project:

```$ git clone https://github.com/M-Ghasemi/Neural_Networks-KHU-97.git```

**Step 2**: Install required packages. (If you just want to run Hw1's files, you can change directory to Hw1 and use it's specific requirements file, otherwise use the project requirements file placed in root directory):

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links```

**Step 3**: run jupyter notebook and open Hw1.ipynb file (or run python files or copy codes to ipython shell)
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
