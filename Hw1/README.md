# ANN-97-1-Hw1

Problems are in file ANN-97-1-Hw1.pdf

**All codes are executed and tested in file Hw1.ipynb**, you also can see the Hw1.htm or execute Hw1.py.
**Solutions that required written answers, are in ANN-97-1-Hw1_Solutions.pdf**

Question 1 is implemented in perceptron.py file, and question 2 is implemented in adaline.py file.

## Getting Started

I suppose you have python3.5+, pip3 and git installed on a linux system. It's better to use a virtual environment to avoid further conflicts with system wide packages.

**Step 1**: Install required packages with executing the following line. make sure that you are in the same directory with requirements file.

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links```

**Step 2**: run jupyter notebook and open Hw1.ipynb file (or run python files or copy codes to ipython shell)
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
