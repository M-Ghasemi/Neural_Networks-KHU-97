# ANN-97-1-Hw2

Problems are in file ANN_Hwk_97_2.pdf

**All codes are executed and tested in file Hw2.ipynb**, you also can see the Hw2.htm or execute Hw2.py.

**Solutions that required written answers, are commented inside the Hw2.ipynb**

## Getting Started

I suppose you have python3.6, pip3 and git installed on a linux system. It's better to use a virtual environment to avoid further conflicts with system wide packages.

**Step 1**: Get a copy of project:

```$ git clone https://github.com/M-Ghasemi/Neural_Networks-KHU-97.git```

**Step 2**: Install required packages. (If you just want to run Hw2's files, you can change directory to Hw2 and use it's specific requirements file, otherwise use the project requirements file placed in root directory):

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index --find-links```

**Step 3**: run jupyter notebook and open Hw2.ipynb file (or run python files or copy codes to ipython shell)
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
